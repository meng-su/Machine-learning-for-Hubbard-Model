# Code for ML of Ising model

Files in dataset can produce dataset of Ising model by Monte Carlo, Ising.py defines a Ising class, MC.py stores functions realated to MC, data.py produces dataset with parallel and stores dataset in source file.

We use cnn to study Ising model, cnn.py defines cnn model.
